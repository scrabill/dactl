# Codeland so far

Wow! I'm approximently half way into day one of [Codeland](http://www.codelandconf.com) and it's been _explosive_! My talk was at the very beginning of the day and the response I've gotten has been overwhelmingly postive!

Even though I had been working on this talk off and on since speakers were announced in December, it is hard to predict how the audience with receive it. Luckily, we all were on the same page. You all laughed with me. Shared in my excitement and overall made it really easy to move through my talk. Some of you have ~~talked~~ geeked out with me about open source and github. [Others tweeted and retweeted excerpts from my talk](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40shannon_crabill%20%23codeland&src=typd). Even just the quick "Thank you!" or "Hey! I loved you talk" in the buffet means the WORLD to me. I appreciate each and every comment. I'm so happy that you were not dissapointed in what I had to say. 

Of course. This has enouraged me to move forward. 

During the open source panel I was asked, if I have another project in mind. Hmm. Another open source project? Well, I think I'm hooked. So yes, I'll be working on another open source project soon (perhaps for Hacktoberfest 2018?). What that will be exactly? I do not know yet. I do know that I have a backlog of project ideas in my bullet journal that I'll revist later this year.

More to come!
